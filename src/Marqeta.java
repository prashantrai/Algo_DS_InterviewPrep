// Below is a section of a city with roads and stoplights. The letters indicate entry points where we measure traffic flow. Each intersection has a traffic light - We want to build a program to simulate traffic flowing through the city so we can test traffic light control algorithms with sample data.

// For purposes of this exercise, your simulation should operate on 1 minute intervals, where every minute lights (potentially) change and cars drive along roads, with each section of road taking 1 minute to drive. 

//       J    
//       |    
//  A ---ðŸš¦---
//       |     
//  B ---ðŸš¦---
//       | 



// Example of traffic flow:
// A car enters road J at minute 2
// It takes 1 minute to drive to light A-J
// Once light A-J is green for road J, it takes 1 minute to drive to light B-J
// Once light B-J is green for road J, it takes 1 minute to drive to the exit of the city
// Total travel time would be 3 minutes + number of minutes spent waiting at lights
// Assuming the car hit only green lights, it would exit the city at minute 5



// PART 1
// Let's start by simulating one road - Road J. 

// - First, create a data model to represent the road, lights, and cars driving along it.
// - Next, enter one car into the road and write a function that simulates time in 1 minute intervals, moving the car along the road and stopping it at red lights until they turn green. It should run until the car has exited the city.

// For right now we can use a simple traffic light control: Start with both lights green on the first minute, and then toggle back and forth between red and green each minute after that.

// Your function should return the total time it took the car to travel through the city.

//   J
