	> Q:  Implement a web crawler which parses HTML
	

> [Glassdoor:2/2021] Implement cell sum operation as seen in Excel. 
	Should support transitive additions if cell has a formula.

> [Glassdoor:1/2021] Design and implement a spread sheet (similar to Excel).
	It should support the ADD only operation.
	The interviewer just mentioned after i was done it should support relative equations as well.
	For example, if you have an equation like C1= B1 +100 and later the B1 is updated C1 should be updated as well.
	This would be trickier if we want to support any later of dependencies.
