m booths are setup and n groups of people would be visiting these booths.
The booths will display robots (type 0) and drones (type 1).
So in binary format the booth string will look in 0's and 1's format.
Each group will visit the booths from row i to j'th position only.
There is an experience factor which is calculated as no of drone booths visited * no of robots booths visited.
You need to maximize the experience factor.

The interviewer refused to provide any example testcase, which caused more confusion.

This question was given by Staff SE: Given the standard mapping from English letters to digits on a phone keypad (1 → "" 2 -> a,b,c 3 -> d,e,f 4 -> g,h,i 5 -> j,k,l 6 -> m,n,o 7 -> p,q,r,s 8 -> t,u,v 9 -> w,x,y,z),
write a program that outputs all words that can be formed from any n-digit phone number from the list of given KNOWN_WORDS considering the mapping mentioned above.
KNOWN_WORDS= ['careers', 'linkedin', 'hiring', 'interview', 'linkedgo']
phoneNumber: 2273377
Output: ['careers']
phoneNumber: 54653346
Output: ['linkedin', 'linkedgo']

Phone: All O-One

Coding 1: Word Ladder
Coding 2: https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/description.

System Design:
Given a system like Linkedin, you have to design a system where you have to intercept 
malicious requests and deny them. Assume a service isMaliciousRequest is available.

Craftsmaship: 
-> How do you define a quality product/system?
-> Describe your strategy regarding code reviews
-> As a hypothetical situation, Imagine you join LinkedIn on a massive team that owns a legacy 
	application. The application lacks adequate testing and monitoring and has slow response times. 
	Consumers complain about this. Deployment of the application often contains bugs. What efforts 
	would you do as a Staff SWE?
-> Rank the following in terms of priority: bugs, no testing, no monitoring, slowness. What do you 
	tackle first?
-> What are your principles of mentorship? How do you manage technical and non-technical mentorship?

Host Manager: 
	Asked about the work where you were regarded well.
	Asked about a instance where there was a technical disagreement.
	Asked about a instance where you mentor juniors.
	
	> Then he asked to design the Job recommendation system as Linkedin

India | Staff Software Engineer | Interview Experience | June 2025 [https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6858262/linkedin-staff-software-engineer-intervi-mg5c/]

Screening: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-stack/

Onsite:: 
DSA 1: Staff Coding - Apps

Q1: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring
The problem was extended to a condition when the source string is wrapped around.

Q2: Shortest path between LinkedIn connections. An adjacency list is given, a source and a target. 
Find the connection distance between source and target. Print the path as well.

I discussed the optimal solution : Bi-directional BFS and coded for the same.



DSA 2: Staff Coding & Algorithms 2

Q1: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder
	I gave the most optimized O(M*N) approach inspired by the below link:
	https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/submissions/1595132398

Q2: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii
	Gave the optimal 2-pointer approach.
	Extension: For the scenario if one string's occurences are less than other, 
	used binary search for the more frequent string.

SD: [LLD]
Design a flexible in-memory cache with customizable capacity and eviction policies.

The cache should allow users to define:

Capacity: Specify how much data the cache can hold based on memory resources and data size.

Eviction Policy: Choose strategies for removing items when the cache is full, 
such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Lowest Priority.

This flexibility ensures the cache can be tailored to meet specific requirements, 
balancing resource usage and performance.

Once the LLD created was agreed with the interviewer, 
it was extended from HLD perspective for multiple nodes in distributed system setup covering 
all the challenges and other adhoc scenarios like hot key issue for a write-heavy setup. 
Also, discussion went around few Redis related internals.


Host Manager: 	

This round started with an elaborate introduction of both me and the interviewer.

Questions were as follows:

Talk in detail about the most complex and challenging project I led in the recent times which had a very large scale. I framed my answer step-by-step as follows (along with few follow-ups from the HM):
-> Team and My role
-> Customer Problem & Business impact
-> Key architectural decisions led/taken by me
-> Biggest challenges faced and how did I overcome
-> How did I maintain timely execution of the project
-> Changes in reqs/unexpected blockers
-> Ensuring alignment with stakeholders

Why looking for change? Why LinkedIn?

Describe a situation where you showed operational excellence.

Describe a situation where you suggested improvements in the project which other engineers in the team could leverage from.

Then at the end, he threw a HLD problem for designing a LinkedIn internal notification system which can handle a very large scale.
There were few cross-questions regarding the different internal microservices and Kafka being used for async handling.
This just had 10-15 mins at the end. Luckily, I was able to create the HLD diagram covering all the components.
