2. N.B.: This problem could be ask in 2 ways,
          a. When organization hierarchy is represented via n-ary tree and in that case 
             we have to traverse tree to calculate the score.

          b. Given a list of employee object records i.e. in JSON object	 
          		 
			 
   
   Employee data aggregation - Given a list of employee object records with performance review scores 
   and associated organization hierarchy, find the employee/manager with the highest average score.
	[another way to ask]given a json, which contains list of employee objects, 
	do some aggregation ( like average salary of employee), do it in object oriented way
	- Given an array of JSON, find various stats like minimum, maximum, avaerage etc on different fields.
		Object oriented approach was tested during this round.

	Divide the array into 2 parts such that the sum of elements of both the parts, gives the maximum possible product?

	eg:
	[1,2,3,4,5]
	we can divide it into 2 parts as
	[3,4] sum=7 and [1,2,5] sum=8
	and it gives maximum product as 56

--- System Design ---
1. [Glassdoor - Jul2021]system design - u r receiving events from mobile and other devices ( like user click event), 
design a system which will retrieve and process these events and support queries like get history 
of number of clicks per hour over last 24 hours. Design fault tolerant, scalable, HA , low latency etc, 
etc very theoretical :). 

Follow up - how do you design client sdk which would take care of server not 
reachable or spike in system
