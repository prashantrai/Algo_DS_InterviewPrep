	 Q.	You operate a market place for buying & selling used textbooks For a giventext book eg“TheoryofCryptography”
		there are people who want to buy this textbook and people who want to sell
		
		OfferstoBUY: $100$100$99$99$97$90
		OfferstoSELL: $109$110$110$114$115$119
		
		A match occurs when two people agree on a price. Some new offers do not match 
		these offers should be added to the active set of offers
		
		For Example: Tim offers to SELL at $150 This will not match but No one is willing to 
		buy at that price so we save the offer
		
		OfferstoSELL:: $109$110$110$114$115$119$150
		
		When matching we want to give the customer the “best price”
		
		Example matches: If Jane offers to BUY at $120
		
		she will match and buy a book for $109 (the lowest offer)

		Coding Round:
			Design a board game like connect 4.
			Build an Object Oriented manner.
			Implement for winning the game in horizontal and vertical manner.
			Follow up: implement to winning diagonals
			Follow up: implement a rudimentary AI to play with (select random spot to place move)
		
		Coding Round:
			You have exchange rates from one currency to another USD -> BTC [some value]
			Use a list of exchange rates for currencies and determine the greatest value you could get.
			Basically like a DFS graph problem, find all paths from Start currency -> End currency.
			Maintain the max and then after explored all paths from start -> finish, return the max exchange
		
		System Design:
			Design a ordering system for stocks.
			Users will place orders and cancel orders.
			Think about race conditions when trying to cancel an order before executed.
			Users can also schedule orders in the future.
		
		Behavioral:
			Basically prepare situations and answers from the Coinbase values list.
