	 Q.	You operate a market place for buying & selling used textbooks For a giventext book eg“TheoryofCryptography”
		there are people who want to buy this textbook and people who want to sell
		
		OfferstoBUY: $100$100$99$99$97$90
		OfferstoSELL: $109$110$110$114$115$119
		
		A match occurs when two people agree on a price. Some new offers do not match 
		these offers should be added to the active set of offers
		
		For Example: Tim offers to SELL at $150 This will not match but No one is willing to 
		buy at that price so we save the offer
		
		OfferstoSELL:: $109$110$110$114$115$119$150
		
		When matching we want to give the customer the “best price”
		
		Example matches: If Jane offers to BUY at $120
		
		she will match and buy a book for $109 (the lowest offer)

	Currency Exchange
	
	a list of currency relationships with exchange values. (BTC - USD)
	find the best exchange rate from currency1 to currency2
	
	they give you a list of relationships like such <src currency, dest currency, ask price, bid price>
	you will need to find a path that will give you the best conversion rate.

		Design this in an Object Oriented manner.
		Include error checking for when creating a file in a non existent directory.

		Coding Round:
			Design a board game like connect 4. [https://gist.github.com/jonathan-irvin/97537512eb65a8bbcb9a]
			Build an Object Oriented manner.
			Implement for winning the game in horizontal and vertical manner.
			Follow up: implement to winning diagonals
			Follow up: implement a rudimentary AI to play with (select random spot to place move)
		
		Coding Round:
			You have exchange rates from one currency to another USD -> BTC [some value]
			Use a list of exchange rates for currencies and determine the greatest value you could get.
			Basically like a DFS graph problem, find all paths from Start currency -> End currency.
			Maintain the max and then after explored all paths from start -> finish, return the max exchange
		
		System Design:
			Design a ordering system for stocks.
			Users will place orders and cancel orders.
			Think about race conditions when trying to cancel an order before executed.
			Users can also schedule orders in the future.
		
		Behavioral:
			Basically prepare situations and answers from the Coinbase values list.

	Round 1: Simulate a File system. Basically a trie question. You can add a file or directory. But you can't add an invalid path for /a/b/c/d.txt can not be added unless you have a, b, c as directories.

	On-site
		Round 1: System Design. Design Slack. Question regarding how will you mark the message read. 
		API + storage layer (main focus), how will you push notifications. How will you 
		show "someone is typing.." kinda feature.
		
		Round 2: Bar raiser - Values and stuff. Explain one thing of your choice in less than 2 min 
		or so.
		
		Round 3: Pair programming - You are given a grid of size 6x7. Two player drop a coin from 
		the top. They select the column (initially the selection is dumb or random) The coin will 
		fall in the bottom most hole available in that column. The player wins if there are 4 coins 
		of the same color in a row or column or diagonal (up or down)
		
		Follow up: Add some intelligence in the players to select the column optimally.
			How will you make the game generic so that it can check for 16 points in a row/column/diagonal
			How will you handle a huge grid
		
		Round 4: Pair Programming - 
			You given data set in the form of list of <curr1 - curr2 - ask - bid> 
			ask means how much curr2 you have to spend to buy 1 unit of curr1 
			and bid is how much of curr2 will you get if you sell 1 unit of curr1.
		
			Now given any two currencies x and y. Find the best conversion rate. 
			Basically a graph problem you will have to traverse all paths from x to y 
			because you want the best conversion rate.
		
		follow up - Rather than hardcoding the data use two apis - 
			1.) https://api.pro.coinbase.com/products to get the id like USD-EUR aka currency pair and 
			2.) https://api.pro.coinbase.com/products/" + id + "/book to fetch the ask and bid price for each one of them. response = request.get(url) is enough to handle the GET calls + response.json() is enough to parse the response.
