1: Store Logs
Given a String like "Y N Y Y N" where Y denotes if there were any customers at a given hour 
and N denotes no customers at a given hour. There is a penalty for a hour where it is open 
and you have a N (i.e. no customer), and if you close at a certain hour and it turns out 
the hour had customers i.e. Y. 

 hour   :  1  2  3  4  5
 log    :  Y  N  Y  Y  N
close_at:  1  2  3  4  5   // close at 5th hour, no penalty
					   ^

 hour   :  1  2  3  4  5
 log    :  Y  N  Y  Y  N
close_at:  1  2  3  4  5   // close at 4th hour, there was a Y and you closed, so you would have a penalty
					^

					   
So, for the above string if you had closed at the 5th hour you would have no penalty. 
However, if you closed at the 4th hour there was a Y and you closed, so you would have a penalty. 

FIRST PART: Given a String and an hour, calculate the penalty.

SECOND PART: Given a string, return the best hour to close for that string i.e., with minimum penalty. 
It does not matter which hour you return. You can return any of the hours with minimum penalty.

THIRD PART: Given an incomplete log with possibly invalid data , find the best closing time for all logs.

------[Apr 1, 2021]>build an "accept-language" parser with region/language/wildcard filtering

>Given a string of accepted languages from a request header and an array of strings of languages supported 
by server. 

Return list of languages that will work for request. 
	3 parts: 
		1. basic. 
		2. language only string w/o country code.

>PART 1: Create a function that requests languages in string format and return an array 
		  of the supported languages stage 
	   
>PART 2: Support non-region specific requests. 
	   		i.e "en" returns ["en-US", "en-CA", "en-GB"]
	   	
>PART 3: Support wildcard matching to return the rest of the supported languages
