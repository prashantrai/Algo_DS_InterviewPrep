1: Store Logs
Given a String like "Y N Y Y N" where Y denotes if there were any customers at a given hour 
and N denotes no customers at a given hour. There is a penalty for a hour where it is open 
and you have a N (i.e. no customer), and if you close at a certain hour and it turns out 
the hour had customers i.e. Y. 

 hour   :  1  2  3  4  5
 log    :  Y  N  Y  Y  N
close_at:  1  2  3  4  5   // close at 5th hour, no penalty
					   ^

 hour   :  1  2  3  4  5
 log    :  Y  N  Y  Y  N
close_at:  1  2  3  4  5   // close at 4th hour, there was a Y and you closed, so you would have a penalty
					^

					   
So, for the above string if you had closed at the 5th hour you would have no penalty. 
However, if you closed at the 4th hour there was a Y and you closed, so you would have a penalty. 

FIRST PART: Given a String and an hour, calculate the penalty.

SECOND PART: Given a string, return the best hour to close for that string i.e., with minimum penalty. 
It does not matter which hour you return. You can return any of the hours with minimum penalty.

THIRD PART: Given an incomplete log with possibly invalid data , find the best closing time for all logs.

------[Apr 1, 2021]>build an "accept-language" parser with region/language/wildcard filtering

>Given a string of accepted languages from a request header and an array of strings of languages supported 
by server. Return list of languages that will work for request.

Return list of languages that will work for request. 
	3 parts: 
		1. basic. 
		2. language only string w/o country code.

>PART 1: Create a function that requests languages in string format and return an array 
		  of the supported languages stage 
	   
>PART 2: Support non-region specific requests. 
	   		i.e "en" returns ["en-US", "en-CA", "en-GB"]
	   	
>PART 3: Support wildcard matching to return the rest of the supported languages

[Same as above - HTTP Header Parser]
	build an "accept-language" parser with region/language/wildcard filtering
	

	Stage 1: Create a function that requests languages in string format and return an array of the 
			 supported languages.
	Stage 2: Support non-region specific requests. ie "en" returns ["en-US", "en-CA", "en-GB"]
	Stage 3: Support wildcard matching to return the rest of the supported languages
	
	
	// https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1126296/amazon-latest-hack-oa-experienced-sde
	U will have enough time to solve these algorithms, but need to take edge cases.

	Part 1
	
	In an HTTP request, the Accept-Language header describes the list of
	languages that the requester would like content to be returned in. The header
	takes the form of a comma-separated list of language tags. For example:
	
	Accept-Language: en-US, fr-CA, fr-FR
	
	means that the reader would accept:
	
	1. English as spoken in the United States (most preferred)
	  2. French as spoken in Canada
	  3. French as spoken in France (least preferred)
	
	We're writing a server that needs to return content in an acceptable language
	for the requester, and we want to make use of this header. Our server doesn't
	support every possible language that might be requested (yet!), but there is a
	set of languages that we do support. Write a function that receives two arguments:
	an Accept-Language header value as a string and a set of supported languages,
	and returns the list of language tags that will work for the request. The
	language tags should be returned in descending order of preference (the
	same order as they appeared in the header).
	
	In addition to writing this function, you should use tests to demonstrate that it's
	correct, either via an existing testing system or one you create.
	
	Examples:
	
	parse_accept_language(
	  "en-US, fr-CA, fr-FR",  # the client's Accept-Language header, a string
	  ["fr-FR", "en-US"]      # the server's supported languages, a set of strings
	)
	returns: ["en-US", "fr-FR"]
	
	parse_accept_language("fr-CA, fr-FR", ["en-US", "fr-FR"])
	returns: ["fr-FR"]
	
	parse_accept_language("en-US", ["en-US", "fr-CA"])
	returns: ["en-US"]
	
	Part 2
	
	Accept-Language headers will often also include a language tag that is not
	region-specific - for example, a tag of "en" means "any variant of English". Extend
	your function to support these language tags by letting them match all specific
	variants of the language.
	
	Examples:
	
	parse_accept_language("en", ["en-US", "fr-CA", "fr-FR"])
	returns: ["en-US"]
	
	parse_accept_language("fr", ["en-US", "fr-CA", "fr-FR"])
	returns: ["fr-CA", "fr-FR"]
	
	parse_accept_language("fr-FR, fr", ["en-US", "fr-CA", "fr-FR"])
	returns: ["fr-FR", "fr-CA"]
	
	Part 3
	
	Accept-Language headers will sometimes include a "wildcard" entry, represented
	by an asterisk, which means "all other languages". Extend your function to
	support the wildcard entry.
	
	Examples:
	
	parse_accept_language("en-US, *", ["en-US", "fr-CA", "fr-FR"])
	returns: ["en-US", "fr-CA", "fr-FR"]
	
	parse_accept_language("fr-FR, fr, *", ["en-US", "fr-CA", "fr-FR"])
	returns: ["fr-FR", "fr-CA", "en-US"]
	
	Part 4
	
	Accept-Language headers will sometimes include explicit numeric weights (known as
	q-factors) for their entries, which are used to designate certain language tags
	as specifically undesired. For example:
	
	Accept-Language: fr-FR;q=1, fr;q=0.5, fr-CA;q=0
	
	This means that the reader most prefers French as spoken in France, will take
	any variant of French after that, but specifically wants French as spoken in
	Canada only as a last resort. Extend your function to parse and respect q-factors.
	
	Examples:
	
	parse_accept_language("fr-FR;q=1, fr-CA;q=0, fr;q=0.5", ["fr-FR", "fr-CA", "fr-BG"])
	returns: ["fr-FR", "fr-BG", "fr-CA"]
	
	parse_accept_language("fr-FR;q=1, fr-CA;q=0, *;q=0.5", ["fr-FR", "fr-CA", "fr-BG", "en-US"])
	returns: ["fr-FR", "fr-BG", "en-US", "fr-CA"]
	
	parse_accept_language("fr-FR;q=1, fr-CA;q=0.8, *;q=0.5", ["fr-FR", "fr-CA", "fr-BG", "en-US"])

/**
* # Step 1
* Throughout this interview, we'll pretend we're building a new analytical
* database. Don't worry about actually building a database though -- these will
* all be toy problems.
*
* Here's how the database works: all records are represented as maps, with string
* keys and integer values. The records are contained in an array, in no
* particular order.
*
* To begin with, the database will support just one function: min_by_key. This
* function scans the array of records and returns the record that has the minimum
* value for a specified key. Records that do not contain the specified key are
* considered to have value 0 for the key. Note that keys may map to negative values!
*
* Here's an example use case: each of your records contains data about a school
* student. You can use min_by_key to answer questions such as "who is the youngest
* student?" and "who is the student with the lowest grade-point average?"
*
* Implementation notes:
* * You should handle an empty array of records in an idiomatic way in your
* language of choice.
* * If several records share the same minimum value for the chosen key, you
* may return any of them.
*


/**
* # Step 2
* Our next step in database development is to add a new function. We'll call this
* function first_by_key. It has much in common with min_by_key. first_by_key
* takes three arguments:
*
* 1. a string key
* 2. a string sort direction (which must be either "asc" or "desc")
* 3. an array of records, just as in min_by_key.
*
* If the sort direction is "asc", then we should return the minimum record,
* otherwise we should return the maximum record. As before, records without a
* value for the key should be treated as having value 0.
*
* Once you have a working solution, you should re-implement min_by_key in terms
* of first_by_key .
*


/**
* # Step 3
* As we build increasingly rich orderings for our records, we'll find it useful
* to extract the comparison of records into a comparator. This is a function or
* object (depending on your language) which determines if a record is
* "less than", equal, or "greater than" another.
*
* In object-oriented languages, you should write a class whose constructor
* accepts two parameters: a string key and a string direction. The class should
* implement a method compare that takes as its parameters two records. This
* method should return -1 if the first record comes before the second record
* (according to key and direction), zero if neither record comes before the
* other, or 1 if the first record comes after the second.
*
* In functional languages, you should write a function which accepts two
* parameters: a string key and a string direction. The function should return
* a function that takes as its parameters two records. This function should return
* -1 if the first record comes before the second record (according to key and
* direction), zero if neither record comes before the other, or 1 if the first
* record comes after the second.
*
* You should then use your comparator in your implementation of first_by_key.

5 hour virtual onsite:
- Easy coding round similar to technical screen
- Bug squash: this was hard & I did the worst on it. Given a github repo with 4 issues, 
  debug them so tests pass
- Integration: given api endpoint that takes a JSON map of data and returns an image file. 
  Parse a JSON file, transform & send data to API, save response as image file
- System design: standard problem like other companies
- Hiring manager: behavioral

[Glassdoor Nov2021]
Given a String, split it into major parts separated by special char '/'. 
For each major part that’s split by '/', we can further split it into minor parts separated by '.'.

# ### Example 1
# str = stripe.com/payments/checkout/customer.john.doe
# minor_parts = 2

# after Part 1 compression
# =>
# s4e.c1m/p6s/c6t/c6r.j2n.d1e

# after Part 2 compression
# =>
# s4e.c1m/p6s/c6t/c6r.j5e


# ### Example 2
# Given:
# str = www.api.stripe.com/checkout
# minor_parts = 3

# (after Part 1 compression)
# =>
# w1w.a1i.s4e.c1m/c6t

# (then after Part 2 compression)
# =>
# w1w.a1i.s7m/c6t


Integration Round
They supply two JSON files containing request log of charges made on Stripe API. 
You write a function to test them by replaying the request to a live API.

Part 1 you compare the HTTP status code

Part 2 you need to record and compare certain ID’s between requests. At first this seemed simple enough, 
wrote the code to do this, it wasn’t working so start debugging. Interviewer doesn’t appear to know 
what’s going on either. With 2 min left says something about the type of ID being different, as in 
you get say a Customer ID vs Charge ID. This wasn’t mentioned in the problem description or in the 
part 2 description.

	1. Design a system to handle role-based access control.
	2. Build a system to send out invoice notifications.
	3. Design a system to keep a running balance of payments for each vendor.


----------
	[Nov2019 -SF- SSE]
	How would you design a system for logging metrics from a login system?
	
----------
	[Sept2019] - in integratio round
		Integration - Make REST API call and compare the response with a json file

----------
	[http://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Stripe-Interview-RVW45619694.htm] - APR2021 - SE
	1. Coding challenge, basically had to even out a series of account balances. Some balances were 
	negative and some positive and had to generate a list of transfers that would make the balances equal to 100.
		Approach: Looped over the balances and for each negative balance looped over the balances again and taking money from the first positive account and generating a transfer. Continued until all balances are even.
	
	2. design a system for delivering webhooks to customers.
	3. Debugging, basically fix a series of broken tests in a templating library.

----------
	Just info: 
	Integration round need you to understand HTTP Rest calls, parsing some Json and sending requests to some 
	API server, I managed to get the code completed with some googling of new libs/apis.
	
	Bug Squash round need you to understand their code base and fix multiple bugs based on some test case failures.
	I was able to fix partial of those, what I could tell was that some bugs tend to be easy but some could be 
	difficult, especially when code was compact, lack of comments, or it touched some advanced componments of 
	a coding language which you probably never/rarely used.
