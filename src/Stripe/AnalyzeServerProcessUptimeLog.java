/*
 Throughout this interview, we'll write code to analyze a simple server process uptime log.
  These logs are
much simplified, and are just strings of space separated 0's and 1's. The log is a string of binary
digits (e.g. "0 0 1 0"). Each digit corresponds to 1 hour of the server running:
 
"1" = <crashed>, "down" // server process crashed during the hour
"0" = <didn't crash>, "up" // server process did not crash during the hour
 
 EXAMPLE: A server with log "0 0 1 0" ran for 4 hours and its process crashed during hour #3
 
   hour: |1|2|3|4|
   log : |0|0|1|0|
              ^
              |
             down during hour #3
We can *permanently remove* a server at the beginning of any hour during its operation. A server
is on the network until it is removed. Note that a server stays POWERED ON after removal, it's
just not on the network.
 
  EXAMPLE: Remove a server with log "0 0 1 0"
 
    hour :  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
    log  :  | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
remove_at:  0   1   2   3   4   // remove_at being `x` means "server removed before hour `x+1`"
            ^               ^
            |               |
     before hour #1         after hour #4
 
We'd like to understand the best times to remove a server. So let's introduce an aggregate metric
called a "penalty" for removing a server at a bad time.
 
We define our penalty like this:
+1 penalty for each DOWN hour when a server is on the network
+1 penalty for each UP hour after a server has been removed
 
Further Examples:
 
EXAMPLE:
 
   hour :   1 2 3 4     // total penalty = 3  (3 server-up hours after remove)
   log  :   0 0 1 0
           ^
           |
         remove_at = 0
 
   hour :   1 2 3 4     // total penalty = 1  (1 server-down hour before remove)
   log  :   0 0 1 0
                   ^
                   |
                 remove_at = 4
 
Note that for a server log of length `n` hours, the remove_at variable can range
from 0, meaning "before the first hour" to n, meaning "after the final hour".
 
1a)
Write a function: compute_penalty, that computes the total penalty, given
 
a server log (as a string) AND
a time at which we removed the server from the network (call that  variable remove_at)
 
In addition to writing this function, you should use tests to demonstrate that it's correct.
 
## Examples
 
compute_penalty("0 0 1 0", 0) should return 3
compute_penalty("0 0 1 0", 4) should return 1


ABOVE QUESTION HAS BELOW FOLLOWUPS: 

1a) "Given a string of server-statuses ("1 0 0 1") and a time that the server was taken offline, 
determine how many statuses the server was off by. 0 indicates the server is running, 1 indicates 
the server is offline"

1b) "Given the previous, determine when the best time would have been to take the server offline. "

2a) "Ok given a string with multiple server statuses nested together, 
determine the best time to take the server offline" example strings were like 
"BEGIN BEGIN 0 0 1 END BEGIN 0 1 END", but only for the inner-most BEGIN/END combinations."
