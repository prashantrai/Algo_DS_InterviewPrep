	 * Implement a Cache/Map where we add key, value along with expiration. This map should auto clean the expired
	 * entry from the map.
	 * 
	 * See here for implementation: 
	 * https://github.com/vivekjustthink/WeakConcurrentHashMap
	 * 
	 * Got reference to this link from 
	 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3802370/java-time-based-map-cache-with-expiring-keys
	 * 
	 * We can also check how com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilder has been implemented and how to use.
	 * 
	 * Another approach using DelayedQueue (found on above stackoverflow page):
