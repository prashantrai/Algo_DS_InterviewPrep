	Question one:
		If Given integer K and an array sorted in ascending order. return True or False is there 
		is subset (1......K) meaning if K was 4, is there 1,2,3,4 in the array. 
		Note you can have duplicates so it can be 1,1,2,2,3,4 and it would be True.
		
		TASK: The code given works for some examples but not all, fix it so it outputs the correct 
		result everytime. You can change maximum of two lines ONLY.
	
	Question Two: 
		[*Solved*: Look for file: CheckIfTwoConvertedStringAreSame_OA_Codelity.java ]
		
		You are reading strings from OCR, the machine transcription tool, that reads images of documents 
		and returns strings. If OCR can not recognize some characters, it will replace with '?' 
		
		example: word "AppLe" if OCR could not recognize the first two characters, it will return "??pLe"
		
		Once OCR returns its strings, the strings are minimized further, for every consecutive '?' of length K, 
		the '?''s are replaced by the Integer value of K.
		
		example: "??pLe" becomes "2pLe" because there were 2 consecutive '?' at the start so they are replaced by the number 2
		
		You are given two strings, S and T of lengths m and n, outputted from OCR, determine if the two 
		strings could potentially be the same word. 
		
		example "2pLe" and "Ap2e" could be the same word, return True
		
		"b1d" and 1aD" cannot be the same word because the last characters 'd' and 'D' are not the same, return False
		
		Constraints: the original strings in the images are only english letters
		
		*My solution*: I just created two empty string, S2 and T2. I looped through S and concatenated the 
		characters onto S2 until I hit a number. Once I hit a number I do another loop from 0 to that number 
		and concatenated "?" each time. I did the same for T and T2.
		
		This converts the given OCR strings to the correct representation with the "?" - "2pLe" 
		becomes "??pLe" and "Ap2e" becomes "Ap??e"
		
		next I check if the lengths of S2 and T2 are the same, if they are not then return false 
		since there's no way they are the same. Finally I looped through each char of S2 and T2 and 
		compared them. If the chars were not equal and neither of them were "?" then return False
		return True as base return of the whole function.

	1. Given an array N, return true if it is possible we can pair all the numbers in the array with equal 
		values. 
		E.g N = [1, 2, 2, 1] -> true as we can pair (N[0], N[3]) and (N[1], N[2]). 
		N = [7, 7, 7] would return false.
		[1,2,2,1] - > True since [1,1] and [2,2] are pairs. 
		But [1,1,2,2,2] can't because there in an extra 2 that can't be paired with anything.

	3. Given a string s, find the minimum number of substrings you can create without having the same 
	letters repeating in each substring.
		E.g world -> 1, as the string has no letters that occur more than once. (look at screen shot in GoogleDrive)

	1. 	There are two wooden sticks of lengths A and B respectively. Each of them can be cut into shorter 
		sticks of integer lengths. Our goal is to construct the largest possible square. In order to do this, 
		we want to cut the sticks in such a way as to achieve four sticks of the same length 
		(note that there can be some leftover pieces). 
		
		What is the longest side of square that we can achieve?
		
		Write a function that given two integers A, B, returns the side length of the largest square that 
		we can obtain. If it is not possible to create any square, the function should return 0.
		
		Examples :
		a. Given A = 10, B =21, the function should return 7. We can split the second stick into three sticks of length 7 and shorten the first stick by 3.
		b. Given A = 13, B=11, the function should return 5. We can cut two sticks of length 5 from each of the given sticks.
		c. Given A = 2, B = 1, the function should return 0. it is not possible to make any square from the give sticks.
		d. Give A = 1, B = 8, the function should return 2. We can cut stick B into four parts.

	2. You are given an array A of N integers and integer K. you want to remove K consecutive elements from 
		A in such a way that the amplitude of the remaining elements will be minimal. The amplitude is the 
		difference between the maximal and minimal elements.
	
		Write a function that given an array A of N integers and an integer K, returns an integer denoting 
		the minimal amplitude that can be obtained after the removal of K consecutive elements from A.
	
		Examples :
		a. Given A = [5,3,6,1,3 ] and K = 2, the function should return 2. 
			You can remove the third and fourth elements to obtain the following array: [5,3,3]. 
			Its maximal elements is 5 and its minimal element is 3, so the amplitude is 2.
			
		b. Given A = [8,8,4,3] and K=2, the function should return 0. 
			You can remove the third and fourth elements to obtain the array [8,8], 
			whose amplitude is equal to 0.
			
		c. Given A=[3,5,1,3,9,8] and K = 4 , the function should return 1. 
			You can remove the first, second, third and fourth elements to obtain the array [9,8],

	QUESTION
		A University has invited N alumni to a dinner. The dinner table is circular in shape. The university has assigned each alumnus an invitation ID from 1 to N. Each alumnus likes exactly one fellow alumnus and will attend the dinner only if he/she can be seated next to that person.
		
		You are asked to plan the seating arrangement. Write an algorithm to find the maximum number of alumns who will attend the dinner.
		
		Input:
		The first line of the input consists of an integer person ld size, representing the number of alumni (N). The second line consists of N space-separated integers representing the ID of the person whom the alumnus likes.
		
		Output:
		Print an integer representing the maximum number of alumni who can attend the dinner.
		
		Note : One alumnus can be liked by more than one alumni.
		
		N <= 1e5

	Asked in 2020
	1. Maximum possible value by inserting '5'
		examples:
		input: 1234 -> output: 51234
		input: 7643 -> output 76543
		input: 0 -> output 50
		input: -661 -> output -5661
	
	2. A string is considered balanced when every letter in the string appears both in uppercase and lowercase
		For example, CATattac is balanced (a, c, t occur in both cases). Madam is not (a, d only appear in lowercase).
		Write a function that given a string returns the shortest balanced substring of that string.
		Can this be solved with a sliding window approach?
		Update:
		More examples
		“azABaabza” returns “ABaab”
		“TacoCat” returns -1 (not balanced)
		“AcZCbaBz” returns the entire string
		
		Solution: Check comment, it could be a balance substring problem

	1. Given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum sum of two numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum. if there are not two numbers whose digits have an equal sum, the function should return -1.
		Constraints: N is integer within the range [1, 200000]
		each element of array A is an integer within the range [1, 1000000000]
		
		Example1:
		Input:
		A = [51, 71, 17, 42]
		Output: 93
		Explanation: There are two pairs of numbers whose digits add up to an equal sum: (51, 42) and (17, 71), The first pair sums up  to 93
		
		Example2:
		Input:
		A = [42, 33, 60]
		Output: 102
		Explanation: The digits of all numbers in A add up the same sum, and choosing to add 42 and 60 gives the result 102
		
		Example3:
		Input:
		A = [51, 32, 43]
		Output: -1
		Explanation: All numbers in A have digits that add up to different, unique sums


		Solution: see MaximumSumOfTwoNumAddUpToEqualSum_OA_Codelity.java 


	2. You are given a string S, which consists entirely of decimal digits (0−9). 
		Using digits from S, create a palindromic number with the largest possible decimal value. 
		You should use at least one digit and you can reorder the digits. A palindromic number remains 
		the same when its digits are reversed; for instance, "7", "44" or "83238". Any palindromic 
		number you create should not, however, have any leading zeros, such as in "0990" or "010".
		
		For example, decimal palindromic numbers that can be created from "8199" are: 
		"1", "8", "9", "99", "919" and "989". Among them, “989” has the largest value.
		
		Write a function:
		class Solution { public String solution(String S); }
		
		that, given a string S of N digits, returns the string representing the palindromic number with the largest value.
		
		Examples:
		1. Given "39878", your function should return "898".
		2. Given "00900", your function should return "9".
		3. Given "0000", your function should return "0".
		4. Given "54321", your function should return "5".
		
		Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
		N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
		string S consists only of digits (0−9).

28. [https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/398023/Microsoft-Online-Assessment-Questions/1311345]
	Given a binary string count a number of operations are performed to make it 0.
	Operations --
	If the number is even, divide it by 2
	If number is odd, subtract by 1
	Example -- input string s = "111"
	number = 7
	operation 1 - 7 is odd so subtract by 1 , number = 6
	operation 2 - 6 is even so divide by 2 , number =3
	operation 3 - 3 is odd so subtract by 1 , number = 2
	operation 4 - 2 is even so divide by 2, number = 1
	operation 5 - 1 is odd so subtract by 1, number = 0 (end of operations)
	Thus total number of operations = 5
	How do we solve this for very large binary strings? say 40000 1's in an input string?
