I like these leetcode questions for practicing: https://pastebin.com/8ZyJx5ME - you should make sure you brush up on trivia (SOLID principles etc) too

also system design study: https://coursehunters.online/t/educative-io-design-gurus-grokking-the-system-design-interview-part-1/579

then delete everything after part- and there's also part-2/3/4/5
