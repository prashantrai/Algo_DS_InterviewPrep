	[looks like hungarian algorithm. Similar problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-accepted-invitations/description/]

	As a theater booking system with N seats (1...N), You made a mistake while assigning tickets. And it ended up assigning 2 tickets to everyone instead of 1.
	
	M (where M < N) people who tried to book the ticket in your theater got 2 tickets instead of 1.
	so basically all the people who wants to watch the show ends up with two tickets.
	
	- To solve this mistake you decided to be smart and figure out if it's possible to cancel just 1 tickets instead of re assigning tickets to everyone?
	- If it's possible to just cancel one ticket which ticket you will cancel? (return list which represent cancelled ticket for ith person at ith index )
	
	Example:
	
	N: 5
	bookings : (6,2) (1,2) (1,6) (2,3) (3,4) (5,2)
	(1,2) (1,2) (2,1) (3,4) (5,7) -> no
	
	answer:
	 Yes,
	 cancel (1,2,2,3,2)

	Build a reservation system for a predefined set of conference rooms given as a list of 
	room Ids [‘roomA’, roomB’...].
	It should have a method like scheduleMeeting(startTime, endTime) should return a reservation 
	identifier (including roomId) and reserve it or an error if no rooms are available.

	- Assume there are 100 rooms, later can talk about scaling to N
	- Assume any number of meetings can be scheduled on any conference room

	Implement a system that can schedule meetings in a predefined set of k conference rooms (numbered 1 to k).

	We have a method int scheduleMeeting(startTime, endTime) which returns any available room (out of k rooms) during the time range and reserves it. If none is available, return 0.
	
	Example:
	3 rooms
	scheduleMeeting called with the below params (with expected output):
	
	(5,7) -> 1
	(7,9) -> 1
	(8,12) -> 2
	(10,11) -> 1
	(10,11) -> 3
	(13,14) ->1
	(11,12) -> 1
	(10,15) -> 0 (No room available)
	(14,16) -> 1
	A few points to keep in mind. These are obvious, but still mentioning just in case:
	
	The scheduling calls won't come in increasing order of time (as can already be seen in the example above)
	You won't have access to future scheduling calls at the time of scheduling the present call. You need to schedule things on a first-come-first-served basis.
	Intervals are open at the end. So, (5,7), (7,9) can be scheduled in the same room, for instance.
	As mentioned already in the requirement above, we can return any available room (not necessarily the least numbered one).

	Given a frog with limited energy capacity standing on a source node. 
	Initially, it has full energy. Moving from one node to another result in 
	a reduction in energy by 1 and an increase in time by 1. There are energy 
	drinks present at some nodes that it can make use of to increase energy. 
	If its energy reduces to 0, it dies. Find the minimum time taken by the 
	frog to reach the destination node. If it is impossible return -1.

[https://leetcode.com/company/uber/discuss/5800007/HLD-System-Design-Stock-alert-notification-system-or-Trigger-alerts-based-on-stock]
	Design a system where a user can have X favorite stocks and has subscribed to their changes. 
	User will set some rules for price drop/ price rise above a threshold or % value and if the rule 
	is satisfied then we have to sent notification to user.
	
	Example: let say user have subscribed to ABC stock and set rule that if stock price goes 
	above 100$ send me notification.
	
	Types of rules can be - opening price, current price, moving average, etc.
	User should get the notification within a minute.
	System should be able to scan and check more than 1 million rules set by users and send 
	notification if any rule is satisfied.
	
	Can someone please answer - How would you design this system - DB schema, notification system, 
	high level components to achieve scalability, fault tolence, achieve the SLO/SLI and which data 
	structures would you use for optimized implementation?
