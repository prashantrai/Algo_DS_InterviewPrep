I was asked below coding rounds during onsite:
/*Asked during onsite*/ 

// Question 1: Given a string S consisting of lowercase English characters, determine if you can make it a palindrome by removing at most 1 character.

// Question 1 Follow-Up: Given a string S consisting of lowercase English characters, determine if you can make it a palindrome by removing at most N characters.


// tacocats --> True  # tacocats --> tacocat
// racercar --> True  # racercar --> racecar, racrcar
// kbayak --> True  # kbayak --> kayak 
// acbccba --> True # acbccba --> abccba
// abccbca --> True # abccbca --> abccba

// abcd --> False
// btnnure --> False
/* 

tacocats
i=0;
j= 7

Time: O(N)
Space: O(1)

*/




// Question 2: Before recess, the children of a classroom line up. Each child knows two pieces of information: 
// 1. his or her own height and 
// 2. the number of children in front of him/her who are taller. 
// During recess, they scramble and loss this order and after recess, they must reconstruct the original order of the line. Design an algorithm to do so.

// Original Line & Goal Line
// Height:  [front]  155  160  145  150  170  165  140    [back]
// No. Taller:         0    0    2    2    0    1    6

// Example input:   [(145, 2), (170, 0), (140, 6), (165, 1), (150, 2), (155, 0), (160, 0)]

// Expected output: [(155, 0), (160, 0), (145, 2), (150, 2), (170, 0), (165, 1), (140, 6)]

// [(140, 6), (145, 2), (150, 2), (155, 0), (160, 0), (165, 1), (170, 0)]
