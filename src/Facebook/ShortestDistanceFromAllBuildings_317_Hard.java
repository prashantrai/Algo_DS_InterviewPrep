				of distances by the steps taken to reach the cell.
			b. For each empty cell we reach, also increment the 
				cell's house counter by 1.
				
		2. After traversing all houses, get the minimum distance 
		from all empty cells which have housesReached equal to totalHouses.
		
		3. If it is possible for all houses to reach a specific 
			empty land cell, then return the minimum distance found. 
			Otherwise, return -1.

	/*
	 * Time Complexity: O(N^2 * M^2),
			For each house, we will traverse across all reachable land. 
			This will require O(number of zeros * number of ones) time, 
			and the number of zeros and ones in the matrix is of order N * M. 
			
			Consider that when half of the values in the grid are 0 
			and half of the values are 1, the total elements in the 
			grid will be (M * N) so their counts are (M * N) / 2 
			and (M * N) / 2 respectively, thus giving a 
			time complexity of O(N^2 * M^2).
			
	   Space Complexity: ùëÇ(ùëÅ‚ãÖùëÄ),
			We use an extra matrix to track the visited cells and 
			another one to store distance sum along with the house 
			counter for each empty cell, and the queue will store 
			each matrix element at most once during each BFS call. 
			
			Hence, ùëÇ(ùëÅ‚ãÖùëÄ) space is required.

/*
 * Question: 
 * 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings - Hard
 * 
You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
Example:

Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]

1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

Output: 7 

Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2),
             the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total 
             travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
Note:
There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to the above rules, return -1.
