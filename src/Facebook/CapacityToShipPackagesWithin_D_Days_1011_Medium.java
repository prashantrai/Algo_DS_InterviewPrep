    Time: O(n long(n*W))
            - it takes O(n) to iterate 'weights' 
              to compute 'maxLoad' and 'totalLoad'.
              
            - O(log(nW)) for binary search. 
              The binary search is performed on the range 
              from 'maxLoad' to 'totalLoad'. The range size 
              is O(n*W) where W is the average weight in the 'weights' 
              array. The binary search reduces the range by half each iteration,
              leading to a time complexity of O(log(totalLoadâˆ’maxLoad)). 
              Given that 'totalLoad' can be as large as 'n*W' and 'maxLoad' can be as 
              large as W, the binary search has a time complexity of O(log(nW)).
              
            - The feasibleWeight function iterates through the weights 
              array once for each call, so its time complexity is O(n).

         Combining these components:
           - The outer binary search loop runs O(log(n*W)) times.
           - Each iteration of the binary search calls the feasibleWeight function, 
           which runs in O(n) time.
           
        Thus, the overall time complexity is O(nlog(n*W)).


    Space: O(1), since it uses a constant amount of extra space
