	 * HashMap + TreeMap [Use this approach is interview]
	 
    Time Complexity:

        1. O(logN) for 'addScore'. This is because each addition 
        	to the BST takes a logarithmic time for search. The 
        	addition itself once the location of the parent is known, 
        	takes constant time.
        	
        2. O(logN) for 'reset' since we need to search for the score 
        	in the BST and then update/remove it. Note that this complexity 
        	is in the case when every player always maintains a unique score.
        	
        3. O(K) for our 'top' function since we simply iterate over the 
        	keys of the TreeMap and stop once we're done considering 
        	K scores. Note that if the data structure doesn't provide a 
        	natural iterator, then we can simply get a list of all the 
        	key-value pairs and they will naturally be sorted due to the 
        	nature of this data structure. In that case, the complexity 
        	would be O(N) since we would be forming a new list.

	Space Complexity:
        O(N) used by the scores dictionary. Also, if you obtain all the 
        key-value pairs in a new list in the top function, then an 
        additional O(N) would be used.
