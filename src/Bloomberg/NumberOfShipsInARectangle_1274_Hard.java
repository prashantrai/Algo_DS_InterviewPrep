	 Complexity Analysis: 

		Let M be the range of possible x-coordinate values between bottomLeft[0] and topRight[0] 
		and let N be the range of possible y-coordinate values between bottomLeft[1] and topRight[1]. 
		Thus, the maximum possible number of points in the rectangle is M*N 
		
		Finally, let S be the maximum number of ships in the sea.
		
		
		
		Time Complexity: O(S*(log2 max(M,N)竏値og4 S))  N.B. Here log2 means log of base 2 and log4 means log of base 4
		
		Each call to countShips requires only constant time so the time complexity will be O(1) times 
		the maximum possible number of calls to countShips.
		
		The worst-case scenario is when there is the maximum number of possible 
		ships (S = 10) and they are spread out such that after S recursive calls (log4 S level of the recursion tree), 
		there are S regions that each contain 1 ship and the remaining regions are empty.
		
		Each region that contains 1 ship, will result in 4 recursive calls. 
		3 will return 0 because they do not contain a ship and 1 call will 
		result in 4 more recursive calls because it does contain a ship. This process will 
		repeat until we make a recursive call with the exact coordinates of the ship.
		
		At the latest, we will pinpoint the ship at the maximum depth of the recursion tree which is log 2 max(M,N) 
		because at each recursive call we divide the search space by half for each of the 2 dimensions.
		
		Thus, once a region contains only 1 ship, it may still take 4*(log 2 max(M,N)竏値og4 S) recursive calls 
		before pinpointing the location of the ship (and returning 1). And since there are S ships, the 
		total number of recursive calls after all regions contain at most 1 ship is 4*S*(log2 max(M,N)竏値og4 S).
		
		Summing up, the time complexity is S+4*S*(log2 max(M,N)竏値og4 S) which in the worst case 
		(when S = 10 and M = N = 1000) equals 342 recursive calls.
		
		
		
		Space Complexity: O(log2 max(M,N)).
			Each call to countShips uses only constant space so our space complexity is directly 
			related to the maximum height of the recursion call stack. Since we have 2 dimensions 
			of magnitudes M and N respectively, and the search space for each dimension is reduced 
			by half at each recursive call to countShips, the maximum height of the recursion 
			call stack will be log2 max(M,N).
