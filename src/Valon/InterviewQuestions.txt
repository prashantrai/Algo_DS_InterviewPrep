We have data on how our servicing team members reach out to homeowners for resolving escalations, 
but weâ€™ve found that how we schedule calls is not optimal. 

We can schedule homeowner calls between the hours of 7am and 6pm, and we want to space out the time 
between the calls within a single day as much as possible for a single servicing team member to give 
them breaks between calls. We want the time between calls to be as equally spaced out as possible. 
If there are multiple options of equally spaced out calls, we want to schedule the longer calls 
and longer breaks towards the beginning of the day. 

Given a list of tuples (day of week, call duration in hours) of calls, implement a method to print 
out the most optimal call schedule. To simplify things, you can assume that calls must start at the 
beginning of an hour, and they last in increments of an hour.
