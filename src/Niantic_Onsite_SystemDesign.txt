Design a JIRA-like workflow page (kanban board), where there are task cards to track who’s working on what, 
the current status of each task, the owner, as well as the metadata for the task.

Lay out the APIs that you’d consider if you were focused on providing the service(s) that power this page.

Requirements
Intake of data become Cards that are movable
Cards move around to different lanes
Cards have ordering within their lane
Cards can be re-ordered

Funcional: 
1. User should be able to add Requirements
2. Cards move around to different lanes
3. Cards have ordering within their lane
4. re-ordering the tasks in same lane or move to different

Non-Funtional: 
1. Our service has to be hightly available
2. Read heavy
3. Consitency is important
4. 100% reliable - every thing add shuld not lost

Capacity Estimation: 
1. 500M user but 1M DAU
2. Avg size od data diffrent req : 200KB
3. Total space : 100 * 200 => 20MB
4. 10 * 20MB


High Lvl Design: 

User <-> Kanban Server/Sys <-> DB

Database: 
Team (teap_id, team_name)
User (user_id, name, enail, team_id)
tasks(task_id, user_id, creator, task_desc, task_status)
watch_list(task_id, user_id)


---- Detail Design: 
1. client 

2. LB -> WebServers

3. API Gateway

4. Severs 
        a. uploads/create (6K)
        b. Read server (12k)


5. DB    
6. Cache
